Next Steps
-----------
[] Create basic terrain and debug camera
	= Terrain
		- Pretty fucking big, will need culling.
		- Flat grass
	= Camera
		- Basic full camera controls (keyboard options also)



General Plan
1. Generate a persistant world map.
	= Camera 3rd Person Isometric Perspective.
		- Zoom and Y-Rotation allowed.
		- Should adjust "forward" to adjust to rotation. (W is always forward)
		- Option for transparency halo to deal with 3rd person iso style object occlusion.
		- Not sure what to do about Y level camera stuff yet...
			* Maybe allow a special top-down camera mode to toggle?
			* Maybe heavily restrict min/max Y levels?
	= Graphic Style High Res / Cartoon Blend
		- Basic Landscape will just be a plane of height-mapped triangles.
			* Not sure how you do biomes and transitions
			* Not sure best way to store this data for the map
		- Prototype will be 100% primitives and shaders
		- Any actual artwork will be all polish after prototype.
		- Lots and lots and lots of shader work.
2. Generate semi-random quest level maps with themes.
